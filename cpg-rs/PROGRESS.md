# PROGRESS — 1:1 Joern port (see GOAL.md for the rules)

Single source of truth across sessions. Update in the same commit as the work.

## Current state

- **Milestone:** M3 — full node-set parity (scaffolding: <global> methods,
  <operator> stubs, TYPE_DECL/TYPE/NAMESPACE_BLOCK/FILE/META_DATA, METHOD_REF)
- **Oracle:** Joern v4.0.555 (`setup-oracle.sh` fetches latest; if the version
  drifts and output changes, record it here and in QUIRKS.md)
- **Gate:** `joern-parity/check.sh` — green, 11/11 methods byte-identical
  (corpus: add.c, ops.c, loop.c, unary.c, forloop.c, switch.c, exprs.c,
  structs.c)

## Next task (start here)

M2, in this order — one corpus file + diff-to-zero per line:

- [x] unary operators (corpus/unary.c)
- [x] postfix/prefix inc/dec (corpus/unary.c)
- [x] pointer ops: indirection/addressOf, pointer decl/param types (corpus/unary.c)
- [x] `for` loop (corpus/forloop.c)
- [x] `do`-while (corpus/forloop.c)
- [x] ternary `?:` → `<operator>.conditional` (corpus/forloop.c)
- [x] `switch`/`case`/`break`/`continue` (corpus/switch.c)
- [x] compound assignment ops, incl. plural `<operators>.` quirk (corpus/exprs.c)
- [x] casts, sizeof, comma operator (corpus/exprs.c)
- [x] string/char/float literals (corpus/exprs.c)
- [x] arrays → `<operator>.indirectIndexAccess`, NOT indexAccess (corpus/structs.c)
- [x] structs: fieldAccess / indirectFieldAccess (corpus/structs.c)
- [x] multiple declarators, globals (phantom ORDER=0 LOCALs), prototypes
  (corpus/structs.c)

**M2 COMPLETE.** M3 next:

1. Widen `oracle.sc`: drop the `filterNot(_.name.startsWith("<"))` filter so
   the `<global>` methods (`<includes>:<global>` and per-file `add.c:<global>`)
   and `<operator>.*` stub methods are dumped; drive those to zero (see the
   first M1 session's unfiltered dump for their shapes: stub methods have p1/p2
   params and ANY types; the file-global wraps nested METHODs + METHOD_REFs).
2. Extend the canonical dump to TYPE_DECL / TYPE / NAMESPACE_BLOCK / FILE /
   META_DATA nodes (new oracle keys likely needed: AST_PARENT_TYPE,
   AST_PARENT_FULL_NAME, FILENAME, LANGUAGE). Pin struct member layout under
   TYPE_DECL (structs.c already has `struct point`).
3. METHOD_REF bindings under the file-global BLOCK.

## Done

- **M2 (2026-06-10):** Full C statement/expression AST coverage, 11/11 methods
  byte-identical. Corpus: switch.c (switch/JUMP_TARGET flattening,
  break/continue), exprs.c (compound assigns, cast/TYPE_REF, sizeof + phantom
  type LOCAL, comma→BLOCK, literal typing), structs.c (field access pair,
  indirectIndexAccess, struct-tag-stripped types, `int[]` arrays, multi
  declarators, `<global>` identifier CODE + phantom global LOCALs, prototypes).
- **M1 (2026-06-10):** Parity harness built; pure-Rust tree-sitter C frontend
  byte-identical to Joern on toy corpus (functions, params, locals, nested
  calls, +,-,*,<,>,= operators, if/else, while). Crate:
  `joern-parity/`. Key files: `oracle.sc` (Joern-side dump), `src/main.rs`
  (Rust frontend + canonical dump), `check.sh` (per-method differ).

## Stuck / deferred

(none)

## Architecture notes for future sessions

- Frontend strategy is **pure Rust** (tree-sitter), decided early; do not
  re-litigate. Joern's runtime is used only as the test oracle.
- Canonical dump format: `LABEL k=v ...` with keys in the fixed order NAME,
  CODE, TYPE_FULL_NAME, FULL_NAME, METHOD_FULL_NAME, SIGNATURE, ORDER,
  ARGUMENT_INDEX, DISPATCH_TYPE; children sorted by ORDER; newlines in CODE
  escaped as `\n`; methods sorted by FULL_NAME; blank line between methods.
- M6 will fold this onto `cpg-core`'s graph schema — until then the dumper is
  deliberately standalone to keep the parity loop fast.
